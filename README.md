#FoundationPress by olefredrik

<p>This is a slightly modified version of FoundationPress by olefredrik</p>

<p>The difference is that this copy has the necessary StyleSheets and Javascripts within the assets folder for those who do not have SASS or is not familiar with SASS.</p>

<p>I, in no way, take credit for this work. The original can be found <a href="https://github.com/olefredrik/FoundationPress">Here</a>. </p>
